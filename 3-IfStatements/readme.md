# If Statements

This is the beginning to a series of lessons on control flow.

# Logical Operators

A logical operator is how we perform logical operations in C++. It is also very important to learn and understand each logical operator:

```cpp
||  \\ or
&&  \\ and
```

# Comparison Operators

This is how we do comparisons in C++. We will come back to this in a later subject but it is important to get familiar with it now.

```cpp
<   \\ less than
<=  \\ less than or equal to
>   \\ greater than
>=  \\ greater than or equal to
==  \\ equal to (different from a single = )
!=  \\ not equal to
```
